discord Dice rolling program

if a message with the appropriate command indicator is sent check its command and run the command associated with it

for the dice rolling bot this would be collecting the number of dice to roll and the value of the dice 

then it would splice that into a list and remove any unneeded parts like the command indicator and the d 

then use the random library and genorate a random integer from 1 to the max roll of the dice

then add this number to the embed to track it and add it to a total number 



In the syllabus you said it was possible to work on the homeworks after the final, would you allow me to do that, i have most of them almost done just didnt have enough time to finish them.
